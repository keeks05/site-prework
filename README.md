Submitted by: **Enrique Melgoza**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challege that I had when creating this submission was getting an accurate GIF on the README. For some odd reason, the GIF conversion only recorded 5 seconds which did not allow me to capture the entire functionality of the app. In adddtion, I followed the given tutorial with how to convert MP4 to GIF and still found trouble when trying to covert the video to GIF. I was able to complete all required features despite the GIF(s) only showing some of them. To be fair it was my first time using GIFS and I found that helpful to know how to work with different file types. Another challenge that I found was understading the sound function and how it worked with the buttons; alot of the code in the functions I haven't really worked with before so I had to look stuff up (documentation) to get a better sense of everything. Overall, a fun task to complete.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[One question about web development that I still have after completing my submission was about the backend side of web development. Specfically with authethicating user data and requests and all that fun stuff. I'm also curious as to how many different web development tools there exist.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time I would make the guessing game random and not so static. How I would go about that is with using JavaScript's built-in random function to create a random number from my choosing. I would have also liked to make the webpage a little more dynamic and interactive as far as user input(e.g buttons). Maybe some animations for the buttons or a special winning screen where a special message and picture would be displayed.]
